 *
 * Final Deliverable:
 * Once the app is run, it allows the user to add three different movies to 
 * their wish list. You first select a genre from the drop down. Next, you 
 * choose a movie from that specified genre. Once the movie is chosen, you 
 * select the number of what place you want it on your Wish List using one of 
 * the three buttons. You can continue to do this for 3 different movies. Once 
 * the user has watched one of the movies on the list, they can replace it with 
 * a new movie. The random button gives user a random movie if they don't have 
 * a preference.
